Okay, I need to create a Feature component for a Garena Free Fire TH website. The user wants it to be professional, so I should focus on making it look clean and modern.

First, I'll set up the component using TypeScript and React. I'll import React and useState for any state management, though in this case, maybe a grid layout would be enough without state.

I'll structure the component with a section element for semantic HTML. Inside, a heading and a grid container. The grid should be responsive, so I'll use CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax to make it adapt to different screen sizes.

Each feature can be a card within the grid. I'll create a FeatureCard component inside the main Feature component for reusability. Each card will have an icon, a title, and a description. I'll use Heroicons for the icons since they're easy to implement and look professional.

Styling is important. I'll use Tailwind CSS for utility classes. The section should have a white background and some padding. The grid will have gaps and be responsive, maybe two columns on mobile and four on larger screens.

Hover effects will make the cards interactive. I'll add a shadow on hover for a subtle effect. The icons will have a transition to change color on hover, adding a nice touch.

I'll include proper TypeScript interfaces for the props, like title, description, and icon. This makes the component more flexible and type-safe.

Accessibility is key, so I'll ensure the structure is semantic and the text is readable with appropriate contrast.

Testing the responsiveness, I'll make sure the grid adjusts correctly on different devices. The content should be centered and look good on both mobile and desktop.

Finally, I'll export the Feature component so it can be used elsewhere in the project. I'll also note the installation of Heroicons since it's a dependency.

Overall, the component should be clean, responsive, and easy to use, fitting well into a professional website design.

```typescript

import { Grid, Icon, FeatureCard } from './styles';

interface FeatureProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon: React.ReactNode;
}

const FeatureCard = ({ title, description, icon }: FeatureProps) => (
  <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow duration-300">

);

const Feature = () => {
  return (

export default Feature;
