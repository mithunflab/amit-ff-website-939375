Alright, I need to create a production-ready CSS file for the Garena Free Fire TH website based on the user's request. The user wants a professional website, so the styles should look clean and modern.

First, I'll start by setting up the CSS variables for colors. Using a primary color for headers and buttons makes sense, while secondary colors can be for backgrounds and text. I'll choose a dark primary color for contrast and a light secondary for readability.

Next, I'll reset default margins and paddings to ensure consistency across browsers. Using a box-sizing border-box will help with layout calculations. I'll also set the font to a system font stack for better performance and accessibility.

For the feature section, I'll make it responsive with a grid layout. Using minmax in grid-template-columns allows the layout to adjust based on screen size, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile. Adding a gap between items improves spacing.

I'll style the feature cards with a white background, some padding, and a subtle box-shadow for depth. Hover effects like a slight shadow increase and a small transform will add interactivity without being too flashy.

The feature image needs to be responsive, so object-fit: cover ensures it scales nicely within the container. A border-radius on the image and card gives a modern look.

I'll include a 'View More' button with a primary color to stand out. Using a link styled as a button provides functionality while maintaining the button's appearance.

Accessibility is important, so I'll add focus states for buttons and ensure the color contrast is good. Using rem units instead of px makes the design more scalable and accessible.

Finally, I'll include media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens. Hiding the view more button on mobile keeps the interface clean, and reducing padding ensures the content remains readable.

Throughout, I'll follow best practices like using modern CSS techniques, keeping the code clean, and ensuring responsiveness. This should result in a professional and user-friendly feature section for the website.
